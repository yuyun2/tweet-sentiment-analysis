# Twitter API Project
This project involves working with the Tweepy API to extract and display user information such as username, followers, creation date, etc and tweets visualized with a color gradient. Results are displayed on a web page created with Flask using Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud (AWS EC2).

# Tutorial
 Run the following code:  
 ``python server.py <path to Twitter API key>``

Then, in your browser, go to localhost:5000/realdonaldtrump to see the tweets
and localhosts:5000/following/realdonaldtrump to see the followers.

# Output
